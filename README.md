# Fun-With-NativeScript-2020
A little public project of me playing with NativeScript.


# Setup Guide

Installed a new project by following the nativescript docs page [here](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/tooling/angular-cli).

```
npm i --save-dev @angular/cli
```

```
npm i --save-dev @nativescript/schematics
```

To try on your phone easily:
```
tns preview
```


To run On Ios simulator:
```
tns run ios
```


# Scaffolding

Proudly created with the Telerik NativeScript CLI:
```
tns create
```

Named the app: `my-test-app` and chose `Angular` with the `Tabs` template.
